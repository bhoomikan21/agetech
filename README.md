# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I’ve created a website to test the assumption that older adults are interested in using virtual reality (VR) to improve their cognitive abilities. The site acts as a platform to gauge user interest while showing potential features of a VR-based application tailored for seniors. These include engaging mind-challenging games, immersive therapeutic environments for relaxation, and multiplayer modes that encourage social connection. By focusing on simplicity and clear benefits, the platform aims to address common barriers such as unfamiliarity with VR technology or doubts about its value.
Research strongly supports the idea that VR can significantly benefit seniors. A study published in Science Direct found that older adults, the mean age was 80.5 years, using VR showed remarkable improvements in cognitive functions such as processing speed, working memory, and overall mental performance compared to non-VR users. Participants in the VR group also reported noticeable enhancements in their quality of life. Other studies suggest VR can boost memory recall by up to 25% and reduce stress and anxiety by 30%, making it a powerful tool for combating cognitive decline.
Despite these promising outcomes, the current high cost and complexity of VR systems limit their accessibility for seniors. However, industry trends indicate that by 2027, entry-level VR systems could become more affordable and user-friendly, featuring simplified interfaces and designs that support caregivers.
My assumption is that senior homes will recognize the value of this technology as an affordable and effective solution for cognitive improvement for their clients. By adopting VR-based programs, these facilities would distribute the cost across multiple users, significantly reducing the per-use expense compared to individual use. Moreover, senior homes could integrate VR sessions as part of their regular activities, providing residents with interesting, innovative, and helpful experiences.
I do believe this idea has a lot of potential and we need some more data to validate it, which is what this MVP provides By building an email list, we can track user interest and understand demand. The website’s green color palette reinforces a sense of wellness, making the product feel easy, approachable, and beneficial.
